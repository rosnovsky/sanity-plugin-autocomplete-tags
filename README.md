# Sanity Autocomplete Tags Dropdown Plugin ðŸš€

## In the process of migration to Sanity Studio 3 ([#44](https://github.com/rosnovsky/sanity-plugin-autocomplete-tags/issues/44))

This plugin creates a custom tags input field for Sanity Studio. This custom input field allows users to type tags, select existing ones from the dropdown or create new ones. This is handy if you want to offer authors an experience of "type, hit Enter, repeat" for adding tags.

## How To Use

This plugin is easy to use and set up. All you need is to have Sanity installed, and its folder open in your terminal.

### Installation

```bash
sanity install autocomplete-tags
```

That'll do it. Easy, eh? ;)

### Configuration

None ðŸ’ƒ

### Implementation

Whenever you want to add tags to an item in your schema, just add this snippet

```javascript
{
  name: 'tags',
  title: 'Tags',
  type: 'tags',
  options: {
    //Locks menu from creating new tags (defaults to false)
    frozen: true,
    //Preset of tags (defaults to empty)
    preload: [{label: "Oranges", value: "oranges"}, {label: "Apples", value: "apples"}],
    //Closes menu after tag selected (defaults to true)
    closeMenuOnSelect: true
  }
}
```

Yep, that's it.
